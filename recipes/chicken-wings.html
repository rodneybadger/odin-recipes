    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp sriracha, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
        <li>2.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp reduced-salt soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp light brown soft sugar</li>
        <li>1kg (2lb) chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame seeds, toasted</li>
        <li>2-3 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Mark the pickled cucumber: mix the vinegar, sugar and ¼ tsp salt in a small mixing bowl, then set aside for 3 mins to dissolve. Add the cucumber and mix well, then set aside for at least 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix the sriracha, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, sesame oil, soy sauce and sugar in a bowl. Add the wings and turn to coat well.</li>
            <li>Prepare the barbecue and wait until the flames have died down and the coals are white. Cook the wings for 25-30 mins, turning regularly and brushing with any excess marinade left in the bowl. Alternatively, preheat the grill to high. Line a large baking tray with foil, then lay the wings across it, pouring over any excess marinade. Grill for 10-12 mins each side, until slightly charred and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Transfer the wings to a serving plate and scatter with the sesame seeds and spring onions. Drain the pickled cucumber and serve alongside with extra sriracha, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
