    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices</p>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li> 
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li> 
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li> 
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li> 
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li> 
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li> 
            <li>½ cup water</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li> 
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li> 
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li> 
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li> 
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li> 
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li> 
            <li>1 egg</li> 
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li> 
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li> 
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
