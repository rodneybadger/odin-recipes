        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 breaded chicken steaks</li>
        <li>250g ball reduced-fat mozzarella, drained and sliced into 4</li>
        <li>4 soft white rolls</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Tip the sweet potatoes onto a baking tray, season and toss with the oil to coat. Roast on the top shelf for 30-35 mins, turning halfway, until tender.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the chicken steaks on a separate tray and bake on the shelf beneath the wedges for 25 mins until crisp. Top the crispy chicken with the mozzarella slices and bake for 5 mins more until the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Halve and toast the rolls, then spread half the pesto onto the bases. Add the chicken and top with the remaining pesto and the rocket. Sandwich with the tops of the buns and serve alongside the sweet potato wedges.</li>
